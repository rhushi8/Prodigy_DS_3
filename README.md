Hello Connection!!

In the the problem statement was as follows-

Problem Statement: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
The dataset which I employed for this purpose was the titanic dataset as mentioned above.
The link for the dataset is as follows- Dataset

Coming to the leanings part-
I performed some of the preprocessing of the data using python.
Made use of the numpy and pandas library.
Learned how to fit a decision tree classifier on the data.
Got an experience doing basic ML.
